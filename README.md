## This repository contains datasets and code used in the paper titled: Determinants of hotel guest satisfaction in wildlife tourism destinations of South Asia 
### Abstract
Wildlife tourism plays a significant role in promoting wildlife conservation and community development in protected areas of South Asia. Hotel guest experience is a significant constituent of the overall satisfaction of visitors coming to wildlife tourism destinations. Using guest ratings and review data from the trip advisor's website between July 2007 and April 2020, this study employed big data analytics to examine factors affecting guest satisfaction in hotels situated in selected eight national parks of four countries in South Asia: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Sentiment and logistic regression analyses were conducted using 54203 reviews from 266 hotels listed on Trip Advisor. Exploratory factor analysis revealed ten factors underlying the structure of guest satisfaction. The logistic regression model using both factor scores and sentiment scores showed that "employee interaction," "guestroom facilities," and "food" were the most significant determinants of hotel guest satisfaction in wildlife tourism destinations in South Asia. Such insights are helpful for hotel owners and managers at wildlife tourism destinations to make investment and management decisions targeting guest satisfaction.
